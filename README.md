# The Techno Blog - Challenge 14

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 14 Challenge, we were tasked to build a CMS-style Tech Blog site from scratch, where users can publish blog posts and comment on others! We followed the MVC architectural paradigm, used Sequelize as the ORM, express-session for authentication and Handlebars.js as the templating language. This app was deployed on Heroku, so you can visit it here: 
[![Techno Blog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116177485/236051531-e3fc9d8a-883c-49c9-99ea-00b300ef6a6c.png)](https://serene-river-60751.herokuapp.com/)
